## CLOOB: Modern Hopfield Networks with InfoLOOB <a name="cloob"></a>

We introduce CLOOB (Contrastive Leave One Out Boost), 
a novel contrastive learning method 
that overcomes problems of the recently introduced CLIP 
(Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training)([Radford et al., 2021][radford:21-paper]).
Contrastive learning has two simultaneous goals:

- Increasing the alignment (similarity of matched pairs).

- Increasing the uniformity (dis-similarity of unmatched pairs).

Compared to CLIP, CLOOB increases the uniformity while preserving the alignment by introducing two new components:

- First CLOOB utilizes modern Hopfield networks to steadily extract more covariance structure during learning.
CLOOB substitutes the embeddings of the input sample by embeddings 
that are retrieved from a modern Hopfield network storing reference samples.

- Second, CLOOB uses InfoLOOB as objective to avoid the saturation of CLIP's InfoNCE objective.
Avoiding saturation leads to more uniformity in the embeddings on the hypersphere. 


### CLOOB Architecture <a name="architecture"></a>

A sketch of CLOOB. In this example, we sample text-image pairs where each text describes the corresponding image.

The $$i$$-th input image is mapped by an image encoder to $$\Bx_i$$ living in an embedding space. 
Analogously, the $$i$$-th input text is mapped by a text encoder to $$\By_i$$ living in the same embedding space. 
The $$(\Bx_i, \By_i)$$ are anchor-positive pairs, where
each of the two components can serve as an anchor.

The image embedding $${\Bx}_i$$ and the text embedding $$\By_i$$ 
retrieve the embeddings $$\BU_{\Bx_i}$$ and $$\BU_{\By_i}$$, respectively,
from a modern Hopfield network that stores image embeddings $$\BU$$ (two green boxes in the left block).
The retrieved image embedding $$\BU_{\Bx_i}$$ serves as anchor in order to contrast 
the positive image embedding $$\BU_{\By_i}$$ with the negative image embeddings $$\BU_{\By_j}$$ for $$j \ne i$$.
Analog, for the second modern Hopfield network
that stores text embeddings $$\BV$$ (two green boxes in the right block).

{: refdef}

In the following the CLOOB objective, 
which is the sum of InfoLOOB with $$\BU_{\Bx_i}$$ as anchor (positive: $$\BU_{\By_i}$$; negatives: $$\BU_{\By_j}$$) and InfoLOOB with $$\BV_{\By_i}$$ as anchor (positive: $$\BV_{\Bx_i}$$; negatives: $$\BV_{\Bx_j}$$),
is shown:

$$
\begin{align} \label{eq:cloob}
    \rL_{\mathrm{InfoLOOB}} &= - \frac{1}{N} \ \sum_{i=1}^N \ln \frac{\exp (\tau^{-1} \ \BU_{\Bx_i}^T \BU_{\By_i})} {\sum_{j \ne  i}^N \exp (\tau^{-1} \BU_{\Bx_i}^T \BU_{\By_j})} -
     \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \ln \frac{\exp (\tau^{-1} \ \BV_{\Bx_i}^T \BV_{\By_i})} {\sum_{j \ne  i}^N \exp (\tau^{-1} \ \BV_{\Bx_j}^T \BV_{\By_i})} , \tag{1}
\end{align}
$$

where the following vectors are retrieved from modern Hopfield networks

$$
\begin{align}
 \BU_{\Bx_i} \ &= \ \BU \ \soft(\beta \ \BU^T \Bx_i ) \ , \quad
 \BU_{\By_i} \ = \ \BU \ \soft(\beta \ \BU^T \By_i ) \ , \label{eq:u_retrieval} \tag{2} \\
 \BV_{\Bx_i} \ &= \ \BV \ \soft(\beta \ \BV^T \Bx_i)\ , \quad
 \BV_{\By_i} \ = \ \BV \ \soft(\beta \ \BV^T \By_i )\ . \label{eq:v_retrieval} \tag{3}
\end{align}
$$


## Introducing CLOOB to Solve the Explaining Away Problem of CLIP<a name="cloob_intro"></a>
Self-supervised learning based on contrastive objective functions
has become highly successful. 
An unimodal contrastive objective for pretraining of vision models contrasts views 
of images with views of other images.
A multimodal objective would for a given image contrast the corresponding caption to captions of other images or, the other way around, for a given caption contrast the corresponding image to images of other captions.

CLIP, a recent multimodal approach, 
yielded very impressive results at
zero-shot transfer learning ([Radford et al., 2021][radford:21-paper]).
CLIP learns expressive image embeddings directly from associated language
(image - caption pairs).  
These rich embeddings empower CLIP
to become 
one of the most important foundation models  ([Bommasani et al., 2021][bommasani:21-paper]).

Though CLIP yielded striking zero-shot transfer learning results, it still suffers from "explaining away" ([Wellman and Henrion, 1993][wellman:93-paper]).
Explaining away is the confirmation of one cause of an observed event which prevents the method from finding alternative causes.

Explaining away can be caused by one or both of the following two problems:
- (1) Learning poorly extracts the covariance structure in the data.
- (2) Learning focuses too much on few particular features.

Explaining away impedes the increase of both alignment and uniformity in contrastive learning.


## Explaining the Explaining Away Problem <a name="explaing_away"></a>

### Examples of Failures Caused by Explaining Away

Explaining away can lead to "shortcut learning" ([Geirhos et al., 2020][geirhos:20-paper])
or the "Clever Hans" phenomenon ([Lapuschkin et al., 2019][lapuschkin:19-paper]).

The left image below is classified as *elephant* because of the texture that resembles the skin of an elephant.
The right image is classified as *sheep* since sheeps are often observed in such landscapes ([Shane, 2018][aiweirdness:18-blog]).

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![not found](/assets/shortcut_examples.png){:width="800px"}
{: refdef}

The left image below is classified as a *boat* only because of wave and horizon line features.
Therefore, boat features are explained away ([Lapuschkin et al., 2019][lapuschkin:19-paper]).

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![not found](/assets/cleverHans4_crop.png){:width="800px"}
{: refdef}

In psychology, explaining away by spurious
correlation is know as the Clever Hans phenomenon ([Lapuschkin et al., 2019][lapuschkin:19-paper]).
For example, the left image below is classified as a *horse* solely because of the source tag,
which is a spurious correlation for the class *horse* in this dataset.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![not found](/assets/cleverHans_crop.png){:width="800px"}
{: refdef}

### Explaining Away Hampers Applications to the Real World <a name="explainAwayHampers"></a>

Explaining away leads to models that take only few features into account, thereby limiting their robustness and, in turn, their application to the real world. 
This is one reason why current models perform very well on standard benchmarks,
but fail at new data, new applications, deployments in the wild, 
and stress tests ([Dâ€™Amour et al., 2020][dAmour:20-paper]; [Recht et al., 2019][recht:19-paper]; [Taori et al., 2020][taori:20-paper]; [Geirhos et al., 2020][geirhos:20-paper]).
Therefore, we require models that better exploit co-occurrences and covariance of features.

### Humans are not Affected by the Explaining Away Problem <a name="explainAwayHumans"></a>

Humans exploit contexts and co-occurences when interacting 
with their environment, therefore are not prone to explaining away issues. 

In psychology, "contextual cueing" refers to the fact 
that items appearing in repeated configurations are recognized faster ([Chun and Jiang, 1998][chun:98-paper]), 
while "compound cueing" refers to combining multiple items for better recognition
([Chance and Kahana, 1997][chance:97-paper]; [Kahana and Caplan, 2002][kahana:02-paper]).
Humans facilitate object recognition by learned associations (covariation) 
and co-occurrences via memories of perceptual interactions that have been experienced ([Palmer, 1975][palmer:75-paper];
[Chun and Jiang, 1998][chun:98-paper]; 
[Chun and Jiang, 1999][chun:99-paper]; 
[Davenport and Potter, 2004][davenport:04-paper]; 
[Bonner and Epstein, 2021][bonner:21-paper]).

For example, objects like a cake can
be recognized even if blurred when a teacup is close to it.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![not found](/assets/teahouse_real.jpg){:width="800px"}
{: refdef}

A model might misclassify the following image as an aquarium solely.
Yet the co-occurence and placement of the pillows, the bed linen and the bedside lamps together strongly suggest a bedroom to humans.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![not found](/assets/bedroom_aquarium.jpg){:width="800px"}
{: refdef}

In cognitive science, this concept of context exploitation is known as CSTM (Conceptual short term memory) which states that humans, who perceive a stimulus,
immediately associate it with information stored in the long term
memory.
>CSTM is represented as a combination
of new perceptual information and associations
from long term memory (LTM) out of which
structures are built.
Material that is not included in the resulting
structure is quickly forgotten ([Potter, 2012][potter:12-paper]).

The CSTM model retrieves patterns from an associative memory to amplify
contexts and co-occurrences, therefore supports compound
and contextual cueing. 
Consequently, the human perception is used to retrieve patterns from an associative memory. Contexts and co-occurences are amplified in the retrieval, while peculiarities of the current perception are filtered out.

In analogy to cueing and CSTM, we use modern Hopfield networks 
to amplify co-occurrences and covariance structures of the data.
Additionally, we use the InfoLOOB objective to avoid the explaining away effect caused by the saturation of the InfoNCE objective.

CLOOB uses modern Hopfield networks and InfoLOOB to tackle the explaining away problem, 
as described in the next two sections.


## Modern Hopfield Networks to Tackle the Explaining Away Problem<a name="mhn"></a>

**Modern Hopfield Networks.** Modern Hopfield networks are associative memories that have much higher storage capacity than classical Hopfield networks and can retrieve patterns with one update only ([Ramsauer et al., 2021][ramsauer:21-paper]; [Widrich et al., 2020][widrich:20-paper]).

Details about modern Hopfield networks are available in the blog
[Hopfield Networks is All You Need][ml-blog-hopfield].

**Associative Memory.** Similar to the associative memory of humans,
our approach uses associative memories to amplify
co-occurences and the covariance structure.
The associative memory of our choice are modern Hopfield networks 
because of their fast retrieval and high storage capacity 
as shown in [Hopfield networks is all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02217).
The update mechanism of modern Hopfield networks is equivalent to
the self-attention mechanism of Transformer networks.
However, modern Hopfield networks are more general
and have a broader functionality, of which
the Transformer self-attention is just one example. 
The according [Hopfield layers](https://github.com/ml-jku/hopfield-layers)
can be built in 
Deep Learning architectures for 
associating two sets, 
encoder-decoder attention,
multiple instance learning, or 
averaging and pooling operations. 
For details, see our blog [Hopfield Networks is All You Need](https://ml-jku.github.io/hopfield-layers/).

**Amplifying Co-occurences and Covariance Structures.** Instead of using directly the embeddings of the input samples,
we suggest to use embeddings that
are retrieved from a modern Hopfield network that stores reference embeddings.
The retrieved embeddings possess richer co-occurrences and covariance structures as they are obtained by averaging over all stored reference samples that are similar to the input sample. 
Replacing the original embeddings by retrieved embeddings
reinforces co-occurences that also appear in reference samples similar to the input sample.
Additionally, *spurious co-occurences* that are peculiar to the input sample are *averaged out*.

**Demonstration of the Advantages of Modern Hopfield Networks.** In the following we demonstrate the advantages of using modern Hopfield networks.
- They amplify co-occurences and covariance structures of features that encode the input sample. 
- They remove spurious co-occurences that are peculiar to the input sample.

The presence of an object in the input is represented by the activation of certain features.
For visualization purpose only, these activated features are arranged as a sketch of this object.
For example the features that represent a tea cup are arranged
to sketch a tea cup. 

In our demonstration the task is to determine the type of location.
For example we consider the location of a tea house. This location is characterized by the *Tea House Concept* consisting of objects which often occur together, like tea pot, tea cup, cake, and fork.

Images from left to right represent:
- The input in a tea house, which indicates objects observed in this location (superimposed).
- The features that are retrieved from the modern Hopfield network by the left image.
- The *Tea House Concept*.

In the memory of the modern Hopfield networks, input representations of different locations are stored including those of tea houses.
Via the retrieval the *Tea House Concept* is amplified while features peculiar to this input are averaged out. 

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![not found](/assets/sketch_tea_hopfield.png){:width="800px"}
{: refdef}
The following image shows the same for another tea house.
{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![not found](/assets/sketch_tea2_hopfield.png){:width="800px"}
{: refdef}

The similarity between the two tea houses is enhanced in the retrieved features (middle image) compared to the features representing the input (left image). The similarity originates from the extracted co-occurence and covariance structure in the retrieved features. Concluding, modern Hopfield networks enhance the co-occurence and covariance structure in the retrieved features.

**Modern Hopfield Networks Steadily Extract More Covariance Structure.**
To demonstrate the effect of modern Hopfield networks, we computed the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the image and text embeddings. These embeddings are obtained at two different training points of the image and text encoder.
We counted the number of effective eigenvalues, that is, the number of eigenvalues needed to obtain 99% of the total sum of eigenvalues.
The following figure shows the relative change of the number of effective eigenvalues compared to the respective reference epoch.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![not found](/assets/increase_eigenvalues.png){:width="800px"}
{: refdef}

Modern Hopfield networks consistently increase the number of effective eigenvalues during learning. Consequently, modern Hopfield networks enable to extract more covariance structure during learning, thereby mitigate explaining away.


## InfoLOOB to Tackle the Explaining Away Problem<a name="infoloob"></a>

The training set consists of $$N$$ matched pairs $$\{(\Bx_1,\By_1),(\Bx_2,\By_2),\ldots,(\Bx_N,\By_N)\}$$.
In the following objectives, for an anchor sample $$\Bx_i$$
a positive sample $$\By_i$$ is contrasted with
negative samples $$\By_j$$ (first term of the objective).
Analogously for an anchor sample $$\By_i$$
a positive sample $$\Bx_i$$ is contrasted with
negative samples $$\Bx_j$$ (second term of the objective).
We get the following InfoNCE and InfoLOOB objectives:
<br /><br />

$$
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:InfoNCE}
  \rL_{\mathrm{InfoNCE}} \ = \ &- \ \frac{1}{N}  \sum_{i=1}^N \ \ln \frac{\exp (\tau^{-1} \ \Bx_i^T \By_i)} {\sum_{j=1}^N \exp (\tau^{-1} \ \Bx_i^T \By_j)} 
   \ - \
     \frac{1}{N}  \sum_{i=1}^N \ \ln \frac{\exp (\tau^{-1} \ \Bx_i^T \By_i)} {\sum_{j=1}^N \exp (\tau^{-1} \ \Bx_j^T \By_i)} \ , \tag{4} \\
\\
   \label{eq:InfoLOOB}
   \rL_{\mathrm{InfoLOOB}} \ = \ &- \  \frac{1}{N}  \sum_{i=1}^N \ \ln \frac{\exp (\tau^{-1} \ \Bx_i^T \By_i)} {\sum_{j \ne  i}^N \exp (\tau^{-1} \ \Bx_i^T \By_j)} %\\ \nonumber
   \ - \
     \frac{1}{N}  \sum_{i=1}^N \ \ln \frac{\exp (\tau^{-1} \ \Bx_i^T \By_i)} {\sum_{j \ne  i}^N \exp (\tau^{-1} \ \Bx_j^T \By_i)} \ . \tag{5}
\end{align}
$$

<br /><br />
In expectation, $$\exp (\tau^{-1} \ \Bx_i^T \By_i)$$ has a high value for a matched pair 
and $$\exp (\tau^{-1} \ \Bx_j^T \By_i)$$ as well as $$\exp (\tau^{-1} \ \Bx_i^T \By_j)$$ has a low value for an unmatched pair.

**Saturation of InfoNCE.**
InfoNCE saturates because it contains terms of the form $$a/(a + b)$$. In analogy to [Wang and Isola (2020)][wang:20-paper], $$a$$ is called the "alignment score" that measures the similarity of matched pairs and $$b$$ the "uniformity penalty" that measures the similarity of unmatched pairs.

To exemplify the saturation problem of InfoNCE, we consider the first term in the second sum of the losses from Eq. \eqref{eq:InfoNCE} and Eq. \eqref{eq:InfoLOOB}:

$$
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:InfoNCE_single_term}
  \rL_{\mathrm{InfoNCE}}(\By) \ = \ &- \ \ln \frac{\overbrace{\exp (\tau^{-1} \ \Bx_1^T \By)}^{a}} {\underbrace{\exp (\tau^{-1} \ \Bx_1^T \By)}_{a} \ {+} \ \underbrace{\textstyle{\sum_{j=2}^N} \exp (\tau^{-1} \ \Bx_j^T \By)}_{b}} \ , \tag{6} \\
  \label{eq:InfoLOOB_single_term}
  \rL_{\mathrm{InfoLOOB}}(\By) \ = \ &- \  \ln \frac{\overbrace{\exp (\tau^{-1} \ \Bx_1^T \By)}^{a}} {\underbrace{\textstyle{\sum_{j=2}^N} \exp (\tau^{-1} \ \Bx_j^T \By)}_{b}} \ . \tag{7}
\end{align}
$$

Obviously, for a large similarity $$a$$, the InfoNCE objective saturates and increasing $$a$$ has a small effect.

**InfoLOOB Prevents Saturation.**
The state where learning is stalled can be avoided by objectives of the form $$a/b$$.
Such an objective was introduced in [Poole et al. (2019)][poole:19-paper],
derived from a variational upper bound on
the mutual information called 
"Leave one out upper bound".
In [Cheng et al. (2020)][cheng:20-paper] this bound is called "L1Out".
For simplicity, we call this bound "InfoLOOB", where LOOB is an acronym for
"Leave One Out Bound", where the objective is the negative of the bound.
The InfoLOOB objective is similar to the InfoNCE objective except that 
the denominator does not
contain a positive sample.

**InfoLOOB Leads to More Uniform Representations.**
InfoLOOB does not saturate and keeps decreasing the uniformity penalty $$b$$. 
The following figure shows how InfoLOOB leads to an increase in the uniformity of image and text embeddings on the sphere, which is described by the statistics of the uniformity test of Ajne extended by Prentice ([Ajne, 1968][ajne:68-paper]; [Prentice, 1978][prentice:78-paper]).

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![not found](/assets/ajne_score.png){:width="800px"}
{: refdef}

A high Ajne test score indicates low uniformity of an embedding. 
Models trained with the InfoLOOB objective develop more uniform image and text embeddings on the hypersphere.


## Experiments <a name="experiments"></a>

**Methods Compared.**
We compare CLOOB to CLIP ([Radford et al., 2021][radford:21-paper]). 
We used a reimplementation of CLIP from OpenCLIP ([Ilharco et al., 2021][ilharco:21-github]) to obtain results, where results of the OpenAI CLIP were not available. 

**Evaluation.** After pretraining, we evaluate the performance of the methods on seven downstream zero-shot transfer learning tasks with respect to their accuracy.  

### Conceptual Captions Pretraining
**Pretraining Dataset.**
The Conceptual Captions (CC) ([Sharma et al., 2018][sharma:18-paper]) dataset has 
a very rich textual description of images but only three million
image-text pairs.

**Results.** Zero-shot results for models trained on CC with ResNet-50 vision encoders for two different
checkpoints. 
Results are given as mean accuracy over 5 runs. Statistically significant results are shown in bold.
CLIP and CLOOB were trained for 31 epochs while CLIP* and CLOOB* were trained
for 128 epochs. 
**In the majority of tasks CLOOB significantly outperforms CLIP**.

### YFCC Pretraining

**Pretraining Dataset.**
The YFCC dataset, a subset of YFCC100M ([Thomee et al., 2016][thomee:16-paper]), has
15 million image-text pairs but the textual description is 
less rich than for CC and often lacks meaningful information. 

**Results Different Encoder Sizes.** Zero-shot results for the reimplementation of CLIP and CLOOB using different ResNet
architectures trained on YFCC. 
Using ResNet-50 encoders, CLOOB outperforms the CLIP
in 7 out of 8 tasks. **The performance of CLOOB scales with increased encoder size.**
